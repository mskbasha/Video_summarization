# Video Summarization Project

Welcome to the Video Summarization project! This project aims to provide an automated way to generate text summaries for videos using a combination of Faster Whisper, Blip2 GMFlow, and GPT-3.5. The process involves extracting key information from videos and converting it into a coherent summary using advanced natural language processing techniques.

## Project Overview

Video summarization is an essential task that involves condensing the content of a video into a concise and informative textual representation. The project utilizes the following components:

- **Faster Whisper:** for Converting Audio to text.
- **Blip2 GMFlow:** A powerful tool for transforming video content into text, allowing for better analysis and understanding.
- **GPT-3.5:** The state-of-the-art language model that generates coherent and contextually relevant summaries from the extracted text.

## How It Works

1. **Video Processing:** The input video is processed using GM FLOW, which helps in identifying key segments and extracting important information.
2. **Text Extraction:** The processed video content is transformed into text using Blip2 , creating a textual representation of the video's content.
3. **Audio to text:** Uses faster whisper to convert audio to text
4. **Summarization:** The extracted text is fed into GPT-3.5, which generates a clean and concise summary of the video's content.
5. **Generated Summary:** The final generated summary is provided as output, offering users a quick insight into the video's content without having to watch the entire video.
